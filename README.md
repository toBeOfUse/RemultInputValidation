# Remult Input Validation

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

This Remult test setup is based on the [Remult TODO MVC example](https://github.com/remult/TodoMVC-example). It adds a frontend that makes it easy to make arbitrary POST requests containing Task entities and displays the resulting state of the database.
